## Overview 

### How it Works
When reviewing cards, this addon:
1. Scans card content based on your configuration
2. Takes the content and queries Wikipedia for relevant pages
3. Adds interactive tooltips showing Wikipedia summaries and images when hovering
4. Saves results in a cache to avoid repeated API calls

### Usage
The addon works automatically - just review cards normally and hover over underlined terms to see definitions. The queries to Wikipedia take a few seconds, a short card (<50 words) should get responses within one second, longer cards (50 to 150 words) will take a few seconds.

Terms are detected in three ways:
- Single words (unigrams)
- Two word phrases (bigrams) 
- Three word phrases (trigrams)
- Four word phrases and longer are excluded to reduce calls to the Wikipedia API

## Configuration

### 1. Accessing Options
1. Open Anki
2. Go to Tools > Ankipedia Options
3. Configure your preferences:
   - Wikipedia Language: Choose which language version of Wikipedia to query
   - Class Name: Control which elements get tooltips (e.g. 'card' for all content)
   - Theme: Light, Dark or Auto theme for tooltips
   - Blocked Words: Terms that will never show tooltips
   - Blocked Unigrams: Single words that won't show tooltips

### 2. Setting Up Your Cards
1. Choose where you want tooltips to appear:
   - For all card content: Set Class Name to 'card' in options
   - For specific fields: Add your chosen class name to those field wrappers
   - You can use any valid HTML class name

### 3. Tips
- You can apply tooltips to multiple areas by using the same class name
- The addon will only process new content when it changes
- Class names are case sensitive
- The class can be added to any element containing text
